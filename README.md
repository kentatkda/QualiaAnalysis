# QualiaAnalysis
qualia analysis using the GW optimal transfer algorithm.

## Abstract
Human emotions are complex and multifaceted, making it extremely challenging to evaluate them directly and quantitatively. Traditional methods of emotion assessment often rely on subjective self-reports, which are susceptible to individual biases and variations in emotional expression. To address these limitations, this study aims to evaluate the differences in emotions due to alcohol consumption using the concept of "qualia structure." Qualia refers to the subjective experience of sensory perception, and by defining and analyzing it as a structure, this study provides a framework for the quantitative assessment of emotional states. This approach is inspired by previous research on color perception experiences and attempts to apply the analysis of qualia structure to a different modality, namely emotions. The goal of this study is to apply qualia structure analysis to emotional states to reveal the differences in emotions between alcohol consumption and non-consumption states. Specifically, short videos designed to elicit emotions were shown to subjects in both alcohol consumption and non-consumption states, and the similarities between the videos were evaluated. This allows for a quantitative assessment of the impact of alcohol on emotional experiences through qualia structure.
